# Amazon-Review-Classification-for-Sentiment-Analysis
Objective:<br>
Design and implement a machine learning model to classify Amazon product reviews as positive or negative using two popular algorithms, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.<br> The dataset consists of two columns: 'reviewText' containing the text of the review and 'Positive' where a value of 1 indicates a positive review and 0 indicates a negative review.<br>

Dataset:<br>
You are provided with a dataset containing a collection of Amazon product reviews. The dataset includes labeled examples where each review is associated with a binary label, indicating whether the sentiment of the review is positive or negative.<br>

Tasks:<br>
1. Data Preprocessing:<br>
   - Load the dataset and perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA).<br>
   - Handle missing values, if any.<br>
   - Perform text preprocessing on the 'reviewText' column (e.g., lowercase conversion, punctuation removal, etc.).<br>

2. Data Splitting:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.<br>

3. Feature Extraction:
   - Convert the text data into numerical features using techniques such as TF-IDF or Bag-of-Words.<br>

4. Model Training:
   - Implement a Naive Bayes classifier and a Logistic Regression classifier.<br>
   - Train both models on the training dataset.<br>

5. Model Evaluation:
   - Evaluate the performance of each model on the testing dataset using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).<br>
   - Compare the performance of Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression models.<br>

7. Model Interpretability:<br>
   - Analyze and interpret the results of the models. Identify key features contributing to positive and negative classifications.<br>

8. Conclusion and Recommendations:<br>
   - Summarize your findings and provide recommendations for improving model performance.<br>
   - Discuss the limitations of the models and potential areas for future improvement.<br>
